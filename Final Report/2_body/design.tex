\subsection{Design Elements}
\label{sec:design-elements}

The design of the drone system integrates hardware, firmware, and testing activities to deliver a reliable and stable aerial platform. Each subsystem was carefully developed to meet the specified requirements, ensuring modularity, robustness, and efficient operation within the constraints of cost and performance. The following subsections detail the design elements for the custom PCB hardware, frame structure, and embedded firmware, followed by the verification and testing conducted to validate their functionality.
