\subsection{System Integration}

The firmware and hardware were co-designed to ensure seamless integration, with all peripherals and control structures mapped directly to hardware interfaces defined at the PCB design stage. The firmware architecture abstracts low-level hardware interaction through driver modules, allowing the stabilisation logic and control loops to operate independently of specific sensor or motor hardware as long as the communication interface remains consistent.

Integration consisted primarily of flashing the firmware onto the custom PCB and verifying that all I/O mappings aligned with the predefined pin assignments for motors, sensors, and communication interfaces. These pin mappings are fixed in hardware and therefore defined early in the design process to avoid later integration conflicts.

\textbf{Integration Scope}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flight controller (ESP32) interfaced with IMU, ToF sensor, and motor drivers via I\textsuperscript{2}C, UART, and PWM.
    \item Power distribution validated across battery input, onboard regulators, and USB programming rail.
    \item Mechanical frame provides physical constraints for airflow, sensor line-of-sight, and connector accessibility.
    \item WebSocket communication used to validate telemetry and control signal flow during integration testing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stakeholder Engagement}
Stakeholder engagement was conducted continuously throughout the project to ensure that client expectations and engineering objectives were aligned. Engagement occurred primarily during the first six weeks (Weeks 1–6), which corresponded to the initial requirements elicitation and design clarification phases. Communication was maintained through information sessions, formal technical query (TQ) submissions, and direct email correspondence with both the client and the unit coordinator.

During the early project stages, stakeholder engagement focused on understanding and refining the drone’s intended capabilities, constraints, and performance criteria. Key outcomes included clarification of power supply specifications, obstacle detection behaviours, and the structure of autonomous flight patterns. 

The process followed an iterative engineering cycle:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Information Sessions:} Weekly sessions with the client to discuss requirements and ask any additional questions.
    \item \textbf{Technical Queries (TQs):} Formal written submissions to document design uncertainties and receive responses.
    \item \textbf{Email Correspondence:} Direct communication used to clarify requirements due to changes in the project scope.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Outcomes of Engagement}

A detailed record of all stakeholder interactions, including questions, responses, is given below:

\paragraph{\textbf{Requirement Changes}} \leavevmode

During Week 6, the project team and client reviewed and refined the ranked and additional requirements.  The proposed changes involved removing requirements that were no longer feasible given the reduced project capacity and the updated system scope, as the number of members had reduced significantly. This was from six members initially to four by August 1, and two by August 25. No new requirements were added; instead, the scope was greatly reduced. The description of these changes can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:req-changes}.

\subsection{Safety Issues}
This safety plan applies to bench electronics work, soldering and rework, and controlled indoor hover testing. All activities are conducted in designated laboratory spaces with restricted access during active testing. Risk ratings follow a consequence–likelihood–exposure (C×L×E) model. Mitigations apply the hierarchy of hazard control: elimination, substitution, e
ngineering control, administrative control, and PPE as a final layer. Full details are contained in the risk register.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Operational Boundaries and Controls:}

\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{11.5cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{gray!15}\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Defined Limits and Requirements} \\ \hline
Environment & Indoor test room only; access restricted during hover tests with signage placed outside. \\ \hline
Training & All personnel must complete soldering and Li-Po handling inductions before handling any equipment. \\ \hline
Hover Testing & Hover altitude limited to 1.25\,m AGL; any adjustment beyond this permitted only during setup phases with props disarmed. \\ \hline
Battery Management & Only 1S/2S Li-Po <800\,mAh packs approved; no swollen or damaged cells. Charging supervised with fire blanket or sand bucket available. \\ \hline
Personnel & Minimum two people: Test Lead with authority to abort and Spotter monitoring environmental conditions and escape paths. \\ \hline
PPE & Safety glasses and closed footwear mandatory at all times; nitrile gloves required for chemical or flux handling tasks. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} All tests must demonstrate thermal compliance, fail-safe functionality, clean electrical behaviour, and incident-free operation. Logs and checklists must be completed to satisfy traceability requirements.

The following table summarises key hazards, their associated risks, and control approaches.

\begin{tabular}{|p{2.3cm}|p{4.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{3.8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{gray!15}\textbf{Hazard} & \textbf{Risks/Mechanism} & \textbf{Controls Implemented} & \textbf{Procedure} \\ \hline
Heating & Localised MOSFET heating or soldering burns & Copper pours, current limiting, heat mats & IR checks, switch-off when idle \\ \hline
Cuts/Abrasions & Propeller lacerations or tool injuries & Shrouds, guarded tools, PPE & Bench test first, enable arming LED cues \\ \hline
Sparking & Short circuits or solder bridging & Heat-shrink, clearance design & continuity test, no live soldering \\ \hline
Battery & Thermal runaway or over-discharge & Voltage alarms, visual inspection & Remove damaged cells, fire control kit on-site \\ \hline
Trips/Spills & Loose cables/liquids in walkways & Cable trays, dry floor policy & End-of-session clearance audit \\ \hline
Collisions & Impact during hover test & Altitude limit, prop shields & Incident log, abort protocol \\ \hline
Fumes & Flux fumes, UFPs from printing & Extraction fans, gloves & Ventilation check, SDS access \\ \hline

\pagebreak
\subsection{Ethical Issues}
Testing takes place in a shared laboratory environment, so ethical considerations focus on safety, responsible data handling, and clear usage boundaries for open-source release. Exclusion zones will be clearly marked, and written approval is obtained from space owners before any powered testing. A spotter is always present to ensure that no unauthorised person enters the test area.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Data and Recording:}  
The onboard camera remains disabled by default and is only activated during scheduled and approved hover trials. Any footage containing identifiable individuals will require written consent before capture. Recordings, if taken, are stored in encrypted form, retained for no longer than seven days and permanently deleted upon request.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Wireless Communication:}  
Wi-Fi telemetry operates under least-privilege access principles. No personal device identifiers are logged. RF transmissions remain within laboratory and local regulatory limits. Channels that may conflict with co-located research equipment are excluded.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Open-Source Release and Responsible Use:}  
All CAD, firmware, and PCB files will be published under a permissive open-source license. Documentation will clearly state:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Intended operation is indoor hover testing only, with shrouded rotors and fully functional fail-safes.
    \item Prohibited uses include surveillance without explicit consent, public outdoor operation, weaponisation, or disabling of safety systems.
    \item Recommended safe substitution components, correct Li-Po disposal procedures, and repair instructions using reprintable PETG parts.
\end{itemize}

This ensures that any derivative builds acknowledge ethical and safety boundaries aligned with the project's academic intent.
