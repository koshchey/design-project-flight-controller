The project presents the design and implementation of an autonomous indoor \gls{uav} for the \gls{uwaal}. The system is intended to operate safely in confined spaces, such as laboratories and workshops, performing inspection and monitoring tasks without reliance on \gls{gps}. The drone integrates sensing, control, communication, and power management on a compact platform built around a custom \gls{pcb} and an \gls{esp32} running the \gls{esp-idf} framework. Key features include stabilisation control systems, onboard sensor fusion, a modular frame with propeller guards, and a real-time telemetry and control interface.

All hardware and firmware subsystems have been implemented and verified individually. The architecture, control logic, and safety mechanisms operate as intended; however, stable flight has not yet been achieved due to motor inconsistencies and limited dynamic testing. With motor replacement, \gls{pid} tuning, and further validation, the system is expected to meet its performance and safety objectives. The project establishes a solid foundation for ongoing development, providing a functional and extensible platform for future research within the \gls{uwaal}.
