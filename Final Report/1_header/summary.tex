This project presents the design and implementation of an autonomous indoor \gls{uav} developed for the \gls{uwaal}. The system is intended to operate safely within confined environments, such as laboratories and workshops, to perform inspection and monitoring tasks without reliance on \gls{gps}. The drone integrates sensing, control, communication, and power management into a compact, lightweight platform built around a custom \gls{pcb} and an \gls{esp32} microcontroller running the \gls{esp-idf} framework. Key features include cascaded \gls{pid} based flight control, onboard sensor fusion, modular frame design with propeller guards, and a real-time interface for telemetry and user control.

All essential hardware and firmware subsystems have been implemented and verified individually. The architecture, control logic, and safety mechanisms operate as intended; however, final flight stabilisation has not yet been achieved due to testing and debugging issues. With motor replacement, \gls{pid} tuning, and further validation, the system is expected to meet its intended performance and safety objectives. The project establishes a robust foundation for continued development, providing a functional and extensible research platform for future work within the \gls{uwaal}.
